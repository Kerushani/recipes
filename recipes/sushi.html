        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul style = "list-style-type:circle">
            <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Nori seaweed sheets</li>
            <li>Sushi filling of your choice (e.g. raw fish, avocado, cucumber, carrot, cream cheese)</li>
            <li>Soy sauce and wasabi (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the sushi rice in a strainer until the water runs clear. Then, combine the rice and water in a medium pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat over medium-low heat until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>When the rice is done cooking, transfer it to a large bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Use a wooden spoon to gently mix the rice until it's evenly coated in the vinegar mixture.</li>
            <li>Place a sheet of nori on a sushi mat or a clean dish towel. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.</li>
            <li>Add your desired filling to the center of the rice. Be creative - this is where you can let your sushi imagination run wild! Just be careful not to overstuff your sushi, or you might end up with a roll that's more like a burrito.</li>
            <li>Use the mat or towel to roll the sushi tightly, using the border of rice at the top to seal the roll. This is where the real fun begins - it's like rolling up a little sushi burrito!</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 4-6 with the remaining nori, rice, and filling. When you're done, use a sharp knife to slice the sushi rolls into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Serve with soy sauce and wasabi, if desired. And don't forget to admire your handiwork before digging in!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So there you have it - a recipe for making sushi that's both delicious and entertaining. Just remember, practice makes perfect when it comes to rolling sushi. And if all else fails, just call it a "deconstructed sushi bowl" and no one will be the wiser!</p>
